# Factions & VvV

**Authority**: TIER 2 - Implementation Spec (see `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` §1 for authoritative decisions)

Three-faction guild warfare with territory control, sieges, and seasonal competition.

## Faction Overview

| ID | Faction | Home City | Hue | Color |
|----|---------|-----------|-----|-------|
| 1 | The Golden Shield | Trinsic | 2721 | Gold |
| 2 | The Bridgefolk | Vesper | 2784 | Blue |
| 3 | The Lycaeum Order | Moonglow | 2602 | Purple |

## Guild-Based Membership

**Core Rule**: Only guilds can join factions. Solo players can create 1-member guilds to participate.

| Requirement  | Details                                                     |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Membership   | Must be in a guild (solo players may create 1-member guilds)|
| Assignment   | Guild leader chooses faction                                |
| Inheritance  | All members inherit faction                                 |
| Cooldown     | 7 days between faction changes                              |

### Member Types & In-Town PvP Flagging

This system mimics the UO **Chaos/Order** in-town flagging mechanics:

| Type      | In Town Attack | In Town Be Attacked | Outside Town | Earns Points |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Combatant | Enemy factions | By enemy factions   | Anyone       | Yes          |
| Peaceful  | No             | No                  | Anyone*      | No           |

**\*Outside guarded towns**: All players can attack and be attacked freely (standard Felucca rules).

**In-Town Flagging (Chaos/Order Style)**:
- Faction members are colored based on their faction (green = ally, orange = enemy)
- Enemy faction members can be freely attacked **inside guarded towns** without guard interference
- This allows faction warfare within town limits
- Non-faction players are NOT attackable by faction members in town

**Peaceful Members** can:
- Craft/supply faction
- Attend events as spectators
- Change to Combatant (24hr cooldown)

**Forced Combatant Flag**:
- Peaceful members who attack another player are **auto-flagged as Combatant** for 24 hours
- This prevents "peaceful" members from ganking and immediately returning to safety
- After 24 hours, they can choose to remain Combatant or return to Peaceful status

## Glicko-2 Integration

PvP kills update Glicko ratings:

```csharp
public void ProcessKill(PlayerMobile killer, PlayerMobile victim)
{
    var killerRating = GlickoManager.GetRating(killer);
    var victimRating = GlickoManager.GetRating(victim);
    
    // Calculate point multiplier
    double weight = 0.5 + (victimRating.Rating / killerRating.Rating) * 0.5;
    weight = Math.Clamp(weight, 0.5, 2.0);
    
    int points = (int)(100 * weight);
    
    // Update ratings
    GlickoManager.RecordMatch(killer, victim);
    
    // Award points
    FactionPointManager.Award(killer, points, "Siege Kill");
}
```

### Rating Periods

- Rating period: 3 days
- Matches accumulate during period
- Batch update at period end
- Prevents farming by increasing volatility
